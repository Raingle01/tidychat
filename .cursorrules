# TidyChat Project Rules

## Git Commit Rule
- After making any code changes, always commit the changes with a clear, descriptive commit message in English.
- Commit message format: `type: description`
- Types: feat, fix, style, refactor, docs, chore
- Example: `feat: add hover preview for collapsed messages`

## Code Style
- Use English for all code comments and commit messages
- Follow existing code patterns and naming conventions
- Keep functions small and focused

## Testing
- Test changes in browser after modifications
- Verify on supported platforms (ChatGPT, Grok, etc.)
